	1. My bedroom was terrible. My comic books, text books, novels and others were everywhere! My socks and pants were on the floors which never were washed after I took them off. What a mass! I can't stand anymore, that's why I stuffed all my books that I will never read anymore into storage room and carefully stack others onto bookshelf before I drown all my clothes into soap water. After 4 hours' fight, I finally won the war.
